This is a program that uses nodes and trees. The file that is used to run the program is 'wordLadderStart.py' and it takes in information
from files 'basicgraph.py' and 'bfs.' The program in 'wordLadderStart.py' enters an interactive a loop that asks the user to enter either 
two words (start and end word) or one word (start word) or 'q' (to quit), checks that the give word or words are in the dictionary,
execute (a modified version of) breadth first search from the start word's node, if an end word was not given, find the node in the 
graph with the largest distance value and extract the ladder between the start node and that node, if an end word was given, extract a 
word ladder from start to the end word, and prints the appropriate information -the extracted ladder and its length.

The file 'words5.txt' is the word file that the program uses.
