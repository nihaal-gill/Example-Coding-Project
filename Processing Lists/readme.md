Question 1: The code below is given below and I have to figure out to make a one line list comprehension from it.
#listOfNumbers is a list of only numbers
#
def processList(listOfNumbers):
    result = []
    for i in listOfNumbers:
        if i<0 == 0:
            result.append(i*i)
        else:
            result.append((i*i)+1)
    return result

Question 2: Implemented a function processList2(inputList, specialItem, ignoreItems) that returns a new list that contains all the items 
of inputList (and in the original order) except 1) any that appear in the list ignoreItems, and 2) occurrences of specialItem 
(if specialItem is not in ignoreItems) should become the string "special" in the new list. I used a one-line list comprehension to 
construct the new list.
  Example:
  >>> processList2([1,2,3,4], 4, [3])
  [1, 2, 'special']
