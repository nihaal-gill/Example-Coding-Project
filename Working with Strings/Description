This program has the a function, q1(inputString), that takes as input a string of letters and prints three things: the 
lexicographically largest largest letter (z/Z > y/Y > ... > a/A), the third largest letter, and the most common letter along with how 
many times that letter occurs. Also, when the output is printed the largest and third largest and most common letters, the output is 
either be lower or upper case so long as the letter appears at least once with that case in the input string.
Example:
      >>> q1('aacyYcqyQQqyqc')
      In 'aacyYcqyQQqyqc', the largest letter is 'y', the third largest letter is 'c',
      and the most common letter is 'q', occurring 5 times
