This program is an interactive program that prints information about "neighbor" words in a file of words. A word is considered a neighbor 
if the words only have a difference of one letter between them. The program asks the user what word the user would like to know the
neighbors of. If you run the functon 'wordNeighborInfo' it tells you three things: the number of lonely words, the average neighbor in 
the text file, and how many neighbors the word that the user asked for as well as prints out what they are. The function 
nestingDepth(inList) that returns a number representing the "nesting depth" of the input list where nesting depth is 
1) 0 if the list contains no lists as elements, 2) one greater than the maximum of the nesting depths of all of the items that are lists.
Lastly, the recursive function areSimilar(item1, item2) that returns True or False depending on whether or not the two given input items 
are similar according to the following definition.

    Two items are similar if:
        1.they are the same type or both are numbers (i.e. float or int type), and
        2. if they are lists, they are of the same length and each pair of corresponding list items (i.e. items with the same index) is 
           similar.
