This program is a function that uses the greedy strategy to determine a set of distinct (i.e. all different) Egyptian 
#fractions that sum to numerator/denominator. The assumptions in this program are that the numerator and denominator are positive integers 
#as well as the numerator is less than or equal to denominator. The function 1) prints a readable "equation" showing the result and
#2) returns a list of Egyptian fraction denominators.
