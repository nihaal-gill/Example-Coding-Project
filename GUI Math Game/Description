This is a tkinter-based GUI program. It generates random simple math problems that involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
#and division. For addition, subtraction, division, both operands are non-negative integers and are less than 1000. 
#For multiplication, both numbers are less than 100. All problems have positive integer answers. As well as it does not generate 
#problems having negative, floating point, or undefined results. Thus, for example, 4 - 6, 23 / 2, and 1 / 0 do not occur.
