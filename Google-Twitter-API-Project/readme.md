This program creates a tkinter-based GUI that enables the user to enter a location and search terms. The search term(s)
#is then ran through the program 'twitteracess.py' and returns all the tweets in a 2 kilometer radius of the location that the user has 
#entered. Then on the static google map it has markers showing the locations of the tweets returned by the search. For tweets that 
#don't have specific geocode information, it puts a pin for that tweet in the center of the map. The marker for the currently displayed 
#tweet should looks different than markers for the other tweets. It also displays the number of tweets retrieved, the link to the tweet,
#and the ability to 'step through' each tweet by clicking on the 'next' and 'back' button.

***Important Note: I lost access to my Twitter developer API so it does not show the tweets. But if you have a working Google Maps API and 
#a Twitter developer API you can input your API keys into the program and will as it is said in the description. You need all files in this folder
#for the porgram to work.***
